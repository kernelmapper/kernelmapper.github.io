<h2 id="what-is-corfu">What is CORFU?</h2>
<p>CORFU is distributed shared log to support strong consistency, fault tolerance,
durability and total order. It can be building block of various distributed
systems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>replicated transactional systems (e.g., Hyder)</li>
<li>consensus engine</li>
<li>replicated state machines</li>
<li>metadata services</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><img src="/images/posts/corfu_a_distributed_shared_log_fig_01.png" alt="CORFU Fig. 1"></p>
<h3 id="client">Client</h3>
<p>CORFU client has very simple interfaces - append, read, trim and fill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In CORFU, each position in the shared log is projected onto a set of storage
pages on different storage units. The projection map is maintained -
consistently and compactly - at the clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="read">read</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The read interface accepts a position in the log and returns the entry at that
position.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a client uses its local copy of the map to determine a corresponding physical
storage page, and then directly issues a read to the storage unit storing that
page</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="append">append</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The append interface adds an entry to the log and returns its position.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a client first determines the next available position in the shared log-using
a sequencer node as an optimization for avoiding contention with other
appending clients-and then writes data directly to the set of physical storage
pages mapped to that position</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="trim">trim</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The application can perform garbage collection using trim, which indicates to
CORFU that no valid data exists at a specific log position.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="fill">fill</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The application can fill a position in the log, which may be needed to fill
gaps in the log with valid content.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="storage-unit">Storage Unit</h3>
<p>Storage units support READs and WRITEs on an infinite, logical address space of
fixed-size pages. Address space of storage units should have &ldquo;write-once&rdquo; semantics.
Client can indicate that the storage page will not use anymore by using DELETE
command. DELETE is used by trim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a read succeeds if the address exists in the hash-map and does not have the
deleted bit set. It returns err_deleted if the deleted bit is set, and
err_unwritten if the address does not exist in the hash-map. A write to an
address that exists in the hash-map returns err_deleted if the deleted bit is
set and err_written if it is not. If the address is not in the hash-map, the
write succeeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fill writes junk at high priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the storage unit points the hash-map entry to special address reserved for
junk; this ensures that storage pages are not wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SEAL command is used for reconfiguration of CORFU cluster. A client sends
messages tagged with epoch number to a storage unit. The storage unit rejects
messages with epoch numbers equal or lower to the sealed epoch. In the
acknowledgment of the seal command, the highest logical page address in the
storage unit is included.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the storage unit maintains an epoch number s_epoch and rejects all
messages tagged with equal or lower epochs, sending back an err_sealed error
code. When a seal command arrives with a new epoch to seal, the storage unit
first flushes all ongoing operations and then updates its s_epoch. In then
responds to the seal command with highaddr, the highest address written in the
address space it exposes, this is required for reconfiguration, &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sequencer">Sequencer</h3>
<p>Clients have to find the log tail to append log to CORFU. Sequencer is like
token generator to find empty log positions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sequencer can be thought of as a simple networked counter. To append data,
a client first goes to the sequencer, which returns its current value and
increments itself. The client has now reserved a position in the log and can
write to it without contention from other clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a sequencer fails, reconfiguration is occurred to change sequencer. The
highest page in each storage unit is acquired by using seal command.</p>
<p>When a client obtains tokens and then fails before using the position, the log
has a hole at that position. The solution is that other clients use fill
command with junk value.</p>
<h3 id="replication">Replication</h3>
<p>CORFU uses simple client-driven chain replication because of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimal design of storage units - no communication between storage units</li>
<li>f + 1 replicas / f failure tolerance</li>
<li>fast reads</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When a client wants to write to a replica set of storage pages (after having
obtained a token for this position), it updates them in a deterministic order,
waiting for each storage unit to respond before moving to the next one. The
write is successfully completed when the last storage unit in the chain is
updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To read from the replica set, clients have two options. If the reading client
already knows that the log position has been successfully written to (for
example, via an out-of-band notification by the writing client), it can go to
any replica in the chain for better read performance. Alternatively, a reader
may probe the last unit of the chain to check if a write has completed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three kinds of failures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>append failure of clients</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To fill holes, the client starts by checking the first unit of the chain to
determine if a valid value exists in the prefix of the chain. If such a value
exists, the client walks down the chain to find the first unwritten replica,
and then &ldquo;completes&rdquo; the append by copying over the value to the remaining
unwritten replicas in chain order. Alternatively, if the first unit of the
chain is unwritten, the client writes the junk value to all the replicas in
chain order.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>failure or upgrades of storage units, thus need to reconfiguration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read failure of clients</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; a projection is chagned to remove a working unit, for example, due to a
network disruption that causes the unit to temporarily detach. Some clients
may remain uninformed about the reconfiguration, perhaps having detached from
the main partition of the system due to the same network disruption. If this
unit sotred the last page in a replica set for some position in the previous
projection, this client might conitnue to probe this unit for the status of
this log position. Then the client may obtain an err_unwritten error code,
even after the position has been completetly written in the new configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To cope with this problem, there are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow read path: reads go to all replicas unless clients know an entry is
written</li>
<li>leases of storage units like heartbeat
<blockquote>
<p>Another solution is to assign leases to storage units, which
automiatically expire unless the unit periodically renews them. Some
entity in the system, for example, the sequencer, must manage these
leases, which is not a heavy burden, as renewals are perfomed at fairly
coarse intervals (typically in the order of seconds). However, a cost
associated with this approach is that we need to wait for a lease
expiration before we can remove a unit from the configuration.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-in-the-middle-of-corfu">Finishing in the middle of CORFU</h2>
<p>I read this paper in the eyes of an engineer to implement the new log system.
The CORFU gives us a good starting point of distributed log systems for strong
consistency. I will plan to review more papers and open sources related to this
topic.</p>
