<h2 id="apache-bookkeeper">Apache BookKeeper</h2>
<p>The Apache BookKeeper is open-source log storage with durability, strong
consistency, and high performance.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="ledger">Ledger</h3>
<p>Ledger is a log file (aka log segment), and it is a sequence of entries.</p>
<h3 id="ledger-entry">Ledger Entry</h3>
<p>Ledger Entry (aka record) is an unit of log, thus it contains actual data with its
metadata. It is a sequence of bytes. It consists of several fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger number: the ID of the ledger</li>
<li>Entry number: the unique ID of the entry</li>
<li>Last confirmed (LC or LAC - last add confirmed): the ID of the last recorded entry</li>
<li>Data: the entry&rsquo;s data which is type of byte array</li>
<li>Authentication code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bookie">Bookie</h3>
<p>Bookie is a storage server. It storeas ledger fragments.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/apache_bookkeeper_fig_01.png" alt="Bookie Architecture" title="Bookie Architecture"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bookie uses two devices, ideally in separate physical devices: a journal
device and a ledger device. The journal device is a write-ahead log and stores
synchronously and sequentially all updates the bookie executes. The ledger
device contains an indexed copy of a ledger fragment, which a bookie uses to
respond to read requests. Writes to the ledger device are asynchronous.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="client">Client</h3>
<p>BookKeeper client is used by applications. It handles requests of applications.
BookKeeper assumes that there is only one ledger writer that is client writing
to a ledger.</p>
<h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
<p>Apache BookKeeper has two levels of APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger API: low-level API for communicating with ledgers directly</li>
<li>DistributedLog API: high-level API for using BookKeeper</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am focusing ledger API.</p>
<p>To create a ledger, a client selects bookies to make ledger, and it stores those
bookies information to metadata storage - which is Apache ZooKeeper. For
fault-tolerance, the client selects f + 1 bookies, thus it can guarantee f
bookies failures without losing data integrity. After successding to create the
ledger, the client gets ledger handle.  To append ledger entry, the client which
is the ledger writer replicates the entry into f + 1 bookies (quorum size).</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/apache_bookkeeper_fig_02.png" alt="BookKeeper operation" title="BookKeeper operation"></p>
<p>After closing a ledger, BookKeeper writes the last entry written successfully
into metadata storage - Apache ZooKeeper. All clients reading from the closed
ledger see the same sequence of ledger entries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also enable clients to read from open ledgers. When clients need to read
from an open ledger, they invoke a call to open the ledger that does not try
to recover it if it is not closed. To aoid reading partially replicated
entries from the ledger, which may not be in the ledger once it is closed, the
client asks bookies for their LAC values. Reading entry i &lt;= LAC is safe,
since the ledger writer has marked it as successfully replicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>
<p>In case of failure of ledger writer before closing an open ledger, other ledger
readers do not know last entry of the ledger. Recovery mechanism have to close
the ledger.
A client which is a ledger reader opens a ledger to read it. To do that, the
ledger reader gets metadata of the ledger from metadata storage. According to
the state of the ledger, the ledger reader triggers a recovery procedure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step of recovery for a given ledger consists of having the reader
client asking each bookie in the ensemble for the last add confirmed (LAC)
field in the last entry that the bookie has processed for the ledger. &hellip;
Since reads are based on entry id, the recovery process can start reading from
the highest LAC it receives, and consequently it is not necessary to read the
entire ledger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ledger reader reads entries starting from the highest LAC, and rereplicates
entries if needed.</p>
